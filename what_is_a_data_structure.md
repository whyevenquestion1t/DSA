1. Data structure is a collection of values
2. Algorithms are the steps or processes we put into place to manipulate these collections of values. It’s what allows us to write a program

A person who knows how data structures and algorithms work and how to use them can write programs. Very good programs. The beauty is that these are timeless. No matter what programming language you choose, whether you prefer one library over the other. Whether it’s angular or react. If you understand these, then you can easily adapt and tackle all sorts of problems.

In order for us to understand the value of data structures, we have to go deep into the way computer works. The fundamental levels. In order for computer to run code, it needs to keep track of things like variables(arrays. numbers, strings). These variables are stored in RAM.

On top of that we have storage where we store things like video, audio files, documents, etc. And the storage can be a disk drive, flash drive, or solid state drive. Data on storage is permanent, we can call it persistent.

### What are the various operations that can be performed on data structures?

Because we know that data structures are simply ways to organize data on our computers. Each data structure has their own trade offs. Some are good at certain operations. Others are good at other operations. Regarding the list of operations, we have:

1. Insertion: Add a value to a certain column
2. Deletion: Erase a value from a certain column
3. Traversal: access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed
4. Searching: we want to find out the location of the data if it exists in a given collection
5. Sorting: order the data in a certain way for future operations
