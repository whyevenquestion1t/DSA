## What is a binary tree?

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Binary trees are very efficient due to some of their characteristics:
- The number of nodes in a binary tree is 2^h - 1, where h is the height of the tree.
- The height of a binary tree is log2(n + 1), where n is the number of nodes in the tree
- The number of nodes in a binary tree is 2^h - 1, where h is the height of the tree.

## What is a log?

A `log` is the inverse of exponentiation. For example, log2(8) = 3 because 2^3 = 8. Simply put, a log is a function that takes in a number and returns the exponent of a number. In our case, we deal with `binary` trees, which means that we the exponent is always applied to the number 2. 

## What is an exponent?

An exponent is a number that tells you how many times to multiply a number by itself. For example, 2^3 = 8 because 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.




## Binary Search Trees

A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values in all the nodes in that node's left subtree and less than or equal to the values in all the nodes in that node's right subtree.

## Binary Search Tree Operations

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Search
- Traversal (traveling through the tree)

## Binary Search Tree Traversal

- In-order traversal
- Pre-order traversal
- Post-order traversal
